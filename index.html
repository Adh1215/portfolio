            <p class="aboutme">My name is Andrew Dominguez Hansen and I’ve been growing up here in Clovis my whole life. I’m a somewhat quiet, laid back kind of person but I’m always thinking about all kinds of things from which of my many games I want to play to how I should handle whatever project I have in school. I always prefer to stay organized and keep things in order, and this has really helped me in getting honor every semester in High school. I don’t stop at just doing things solo though; I’ve already led a small team to complete an entire 4-month long project at CART (Center for Advanced Research and Technology) and the end result was really impressive. These last few years I’ve managed to improve a LOT in all kinds of areas. I can speak better in front of crowds, I can work better with people, I can think in ways I wasn’t able to before. I’m pretty sure that I’m going to continue to improve in all of these areas and more at this rapid pace for a while, as long as I can continue to challenge myself. Please, feel free to explore this website (it has blood sweat and tears poured into it, I hope you enjoy it) or contact me by either going to my contact page.
