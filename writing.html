                <p class="essaytitle">Why CART should implement conscious creator of content curriculum</p>
            </h2>
            <p class="indent">Technology is officially an inescapable part of modern life, for better or for worse. This is true more than anywhere among teens. 94% of teens that go online using a mobile device use social media daily (Health). Unfortunately, no matter how good your batch as a whole may be, there will always be one bad cookie, and this especially applies to teens and social media. CART administrators and teachers can help remedy the situation that is currently plaguing socializing via the internet, at least partially, by implementing curriculum that teaches students the importance of being a “conscious creator of content.”</p>
            <p class="indent">A strong reason to implement this stuff is that there is a surprisingly large industry that has one job: dig up stuff on you. As most people know, nothing you ever do can be permanently deleted. Many employers nowadays will hire people or companies to do a background check on you, mainly focusing on social media. Specifically, about 70% corporate recruiters have rejected at least 1 candidate from a position because of something found online. This typically includes discriminatory comments, poor communication skills, and content about alcohol or drug abuse (Ivester 47). With this curriculum in place, it can be taught how to combat being bullied, as over half of those bullied don’t end up telling their parents what’s happening (cyber bullying statistics).</p>
            <p class="indent">Even if student doesn’t have any plans to go anywhere in life, this stuff is definitely valuable. Maybe the student is fine living with their parents forever and don’t want, to get into college, grad school, or get a job. Well unfortunately, it’s been proven that many other people look you up, even if it’s not for formal reasons. In a study done, 81% of people in their early twenties will do a quick search online before a first date (Ivester 51). That first impression can completely change how the date goes. It doesn’t even end there though. Other people that may search you up may be “the old conservative grandmother that writes you out of the will, or the future landlady that doesn’t think you look like her kind of tenant” (Ivester 51). Teaching correct moral conduct online has more benefits than just those that typically come to mind.</p>
            <p class="indent">Situations that are a bit more extreme can arise if students don’t know all that need to as well. For example, I didn’t even know this, but it completely illegal to have any sexual photos of anyone under 18, even if you’re also a minor (Ivester 62). There are plenty of laws that tons of people can get busted for, but no one realizes how much trouble they can get into. For example, someone may just think that they’re having fun joking with someone, maybe even a friend, but if that friend does something drastic and ends up killing themselves, no one else is at fault but the antagonist. You can get sued, or even arrested for it in some states. In Massachusetts for example, some teens were charged with causing the suicide of a young girl after harassing her for months (Vincent Ronald Ross).</p>
            <p class="indent">Sometimes people don’t think about what could happen if they go through with their actions. This can be seen in a prime example named Justine Sacco. Unfortunately, she made that exact mistake. She made the mistake of tweeting out “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white,” and, despite only having 170 followers, she nearly instantly blew up (Ronson). The new “cool” thing to do was make sure everyone gets online and says how much they hate her. This can easily happen to any student, even more so than Mrs. Sacco considering teens more frequently don’t consider the potential consequences of what they do and/or say. With the knowledge of what happened to Justine Sacco, especially if the students know what happened in depth, it can show them some problems with the internet they may have not ever realized or thought about before.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some examples of things kids may not have thought about are the biases that are so blatantly present in the online world today. Some of these biases include the superiority bias, negative information bias, and the first impression bias. Just looking at one bias, the first impression bias, it can easily be seen how susceptible people are to being criticized or judged unfairly online. The first impression bias is how people will typically take whatever impression they get from you in your first interaction, and assume that’s how you genuinely are at all times (Ivester 43). So, if some CART student were to make one mistake, anyone that doesn’t know them would automatically assume that that student was like that, and would probably begin a hate train of their own. It’s no question whether or not CART staff wants that for any of their students, and digital responsibility curriculum could seriously affect whether or not a student does something regrettable. Many students that have been taught about these biases have realized that although it’s not always fair or justified, people will judge them based off what they see, causing them to be more careful about what they do and saving them trouble.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of the day, the decision is pretty black and white: either implement this important material, or don’t. With technology being so integrated into our lives, it is a great idea to do the former, and it won’t even take much effort. Just spend a few hours doing some research, and implement that into the curriculum. It is more than worth it to potentially save lives of students.</p><br>

            <h2>Wargames review</h2>
            <p class="indent">In Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, the book heavily and blatantly alludes to Wargames in the challenge of the first gate. After finding the first gate’s location, Parzival goes in and is, for some reason, playing Galaga. Someone comes in and says “Hi David!” This was EXACTLY from the movie. The author does mess it up a little bit by forgetting just a few words, but it was so much fun reading the lines as they popped up in the movie. I was sitting, reading the words “Ah, David! Nice of you to join us!” as they were said in the movie. Parzival said that he loved Wargames, and that it was one of his favorite movies ever.</p>
            <p class="indent">It was definitely a good movie, with some interesting ideas at play in it, but it surely isn’t my FAVORITE movie ever, I’ll probably like ready player one a bit more. The movie had its flaws but also plenty of good parts, and overall more good than bad. We’ll save the best for last. The bad parts of the movie were mainly just how incredibly dumb and/or stubborn some characters were at certain points. One example is how the military had this system that they hardly understood how it worked. They left it so vulnerable a KID was able to ACCIDENTALLY hack it. Also, David was under extreme suspicion as a Russian spy so what does he do? He breaks out of containment making himself more suspicious. However, it did have tons of humor thrown throughout the movie, and all of the ways the directors tried to replicate actual hacking was both funny and interesting. Overall, The movie was great.</p>

            <h2>HR complaint</h2>
            Dear Mr. Krabs, <br>
            <p class="indent">
                Hello, this is Andrew from the spatula and grill maintenance department. I am the head of said department and have reached this position because of my sense of justice, and ability to know when something is not being done correctly, which is exactly what I saw recently. On October 2nd, 2017, I was taking my lunch at about 12:05 P.M. and about 47.63 seconds, and walked outside to see Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen from finance wrestling with some seagulls; specifically he was pile-driving them. He was just walking around between the 7 that were out there and was one by one slamming them into the floor. I did some investigation and found out that my worst fears were true, the seagulls did nothing wrong and had no reason to be handled so violently. I both checked camera footage, and asked the seagulls involved here, and sure enough, Smitty walked right up to them and began attacking them with no warning or reason. This problem needs to be addressed ASAP, we treat all sea creatures under the sea as politely as possible (as long as they have money), and quite frankly this action is unacceptable. Smitty Werbenjegermanjensen needs to be punished, preferably by taking away his spot as number one, or even maybe termination. Please take notice of this atrocity, we cannot allow this behavior to continue any longer.<br>
                Sincerely,
                <br> <span class="cursive">Andrew Dominguez Hansen</span>
